Description: OpenID plugin for WordPress
 OpenID is an open standard that allows users to authenticate to websites
 without having to create a new password. This plugin allows users to login to
 their local WordPress account using an OpenID, as well as enabling commenters
 to leave authenticated comments with OpenID. The plugin also includes an
 OpenID provider, enabling users to login to OpenID-enabled sites using their
 own personal WordPress account.
